# duval_prop_2023
This is a python script that compares all home sales in 2023 to those sold to people outside Duval zip codes.

I got the property tax rolls from https://floridarevenue.com/property/dataportal/Pages/default.aspx?path=/property/dataportal/Documents/PTO%20Data%20Portal/Tax%20Roll%20Data%20Files/NAL/2024P

You want the file for Duval (unless you are interested in another county).  Duval is "Duval 26 Preliminary NAL 2024.zip"

I couldn't add the file to the project it is too big.
